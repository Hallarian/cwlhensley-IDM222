          <h4>A Tale of History</h4>
      Not much is known of the history of Thera before the fall of the First Theran Empire.  Some speak of a great cleansing brought forth by the god Enkindle, goddess of light, whose purification took the people of Thera to the brink of extinction.  Most never speak of it, but through the ages, whispers of this event have turned into tales, passed from one generation to another; a warning of doom to those that would show contempt for the gods.  And it all began with a terrible war that engulfed the land.
<p>
It is said that the Theran people were once united under one banner, one great empire whose citizens ruled with the guidance of just rulers.  The beauty of their land was what people treasured most.  The vibrant cities of Thera were expressions of nature, as if time itself had carved them out stone.  The walls of the Theran capital were built around a grand structure so the emperor could watch over the land and be a blanket that protected the people.
<p>
Magnificence was found in cities and villages surrounding the capital, in the forests and plains of Thera.  Brick roads stretched across the land connecting each town together, while constructed waterways made for a better quality of life.  Tall reeds of grass and flowers rose up along the water’s edge, giving joy to the children who played nearby.  Massive trees, able to sample the water’s life force, surrounded the walls and homes of the cities, offering protection from the chills of night.
<p>
It was indeed a prosperous time.  Everyone worked together for the common goal of making this empire shine as brightly as Enkindle herself.  Statues depicting battles, and the heroes who fought them, filled the streets.  Stories were carved into walls, telling tales about the gods of antiquity.
<p>
Of course debate would eventually rise among the people, after temples containing statues of gods depicted in human form were erected.  Some believed that these gods that graced the evening sky were not meant to be portrayed as such.  For man was flawed, and this act was blasphemous.  People even went so far as to chastise the artists who were commissioned to sculpt them.
<p>
But the voice of the minority could not be heard over the voice of the majority, and most believed that it was an honor to the gods, and to Enkindle as well.  So the pleas of those who took to the streets yelling, “All must be humble before a god,” fell on deaf ears.  Ironically, over time these warnings would prove true.
<p>
Soon the empire grew too large.  Over population led to food shortages which in turn led to famine and disease.  The streets and roads of the empire filled with beggars.  The marketplaces became rampant with thievery and murder.  Since there was no more land to safely cultivate, and the West Mountains were too vast to climb or travel around, governors turned to the emperor for help.
<p>
Although his name is now lost to history it is said that the he was a wise and kind man who believed that the people should be free to rule themselves.  He was to be only the example to which many should aspire. He would only take control of his people when the need was most dire.  And so the emperor sent word to all those capable, “Build massive ships capable of crossing the vast ocean of Thera”.
<p>
Now, Therans have always held a fear of the unknown and that which they could not see with their own eyes.  To them the sea was an endless void that would swallow whoever was foolish enough to venture too far.  But the emperor was not a slave to his fear, and he assured his people that their fears were unfounded; “Perhaps there were those on the other side of the world who thought the same thing”.  For the emperor, himself, spent many a nights looking to the sky hoping that there were others with whom the Therans shared their world with.
<p>
After he laid his people’s fears to rest they began building a fleet of ships.  Entire forests were stripped down to plains of stumps and broken branches.  Even those trees that inhabited the cities were not spared the axe.  This again led to outrage by a small fraction of people. Dubbed the Ancients for their traditionalist view of things, these Therans rebuked the emperor’s rule for ignoring signs from the gods, and needlessly tearing trees from their resting place.  But the voices of the offended were ignored by the masses, many of whom joined the armies that set out on the ships in their search for resources.
<p>
Months passed as vessels left port in all directions, leaving families without sons, without fathers.  Several ships retuned fairly quickly with tales of islands to the south that were inhabited by strange animals, wild fruits, and delicious vegetables.  Then ships from the north brought with them the furs of wild beasts, and stories of lands locked in ice.  Few lives were lost in these journeys and those that died were honored by lords and common folk alike for their bravery.
<p>
However, a long time had passed and the ships that were eastward bound had yet to return; growing anxiety fell to the emperor and the people of Thera.  Few voiced their concerns, for it was a time of prosperity once more.  Most preferred to live in ignorance of what may have happened to those doomed ships.  Even the so called Ancients were quiet; jokes and rumors persisted that these “rabble-rousers” simply picked up and left the core cities of the empire.  Many others had already done so, settling in the newly discovered lands.
<p>
After a while many began to believe that the fate of the men aboard those vessels would never be revealed.  Unfortunately for the people of the First Theran Empire, that would prove to be untrue.  In time word reached the emperor that a ship had returned from the East.  The ruler breathed a sigh of relief when hearing this news, but his liberation from anxiety would be just a fleeting moment.  The ship was abandoned and the splintered-broken oars, torn sails, and blood stained deck spoke of a gruesome tale.
<p>
Still the wise man, the emperor prepared for the possibility of a coming storm.  Armies of men on land and in sea fairing vessels patrolled the harbors.  Warnings went out to the cities, and the streets became deserted; commerce was brought to a stand-still.  All was quiet, and for a while it stayed that way.  The days were filled with beauty as Enkindle shone ever bright as the deep blue sky remained free from cloud and gale.  But the dread of war loomed over every man, woman, and child.
<p>
Finally, one chilled morning, as if by some mystic squall blowing against the wind, ships began to appear on the horizon.  One by one, pulling closer to land surrounded by a strange haze, the ghostly ships drifted pass the patrolling armada.  A myriad of armored soldiers stood on the waterfront, many holding their breaths.  And just as it seemed that the ships would continue until they crashed into the wooden planks of the wharf, they slowed and eventually glided to a stop.
<p>
Not a bird in the sky or the crashing waves could break the calm of a thousand empty ships just floating, teeming with lifelessness.  The silence was louder than anything the Therans had ever heard.  Forever passed and rumblings of a few soldiers finally pierced the veil of a muted world.
<p>
Many more began to stand down from their battle-ready stance and broke ranks, strolling to the edge of the docks.  Small oared boats were boarded by the Thean guardsmen, who then proceeded to row to the deserted ships.  Taking a cue from the bravest, many others followed; before long every deserted ship was now surrounded with soldiers, intent on scouring every inch on board.  Even those vessels patrolling the water ventured towards the empty ships.
<p>
But the ships were not empty, and the people of Thera would now see first hand what fate had befallen their kinsmen.  Just as the soldiers set foot on the decks of the ships, a shrill screeching noise echoed throughout the harbor, freezing the blood of those close enough to hear the cry.  What followed were the pleas and squeals of agony, like animals being led to slaughter.  Those lucky enough to escape leapt from the ships into the icy waters below.  
The docks grew silent once more save for the splashing of men struggling to stay afloat in the heavy arctic-like sea.  Then horror gripped the men of Thera as a great shriek was upon them once more.  Darkness rose up from the ethereal vessels into the sky in form of black winged creatures; the underworld was upon man and it demanded blood.
<p>
Deadly shadows now filled the heavens and brought a terrible force down upon Thera.  These Demons lunged at anything with a heartbeat, using their razor talons to tear and mangle flesh.  Chaos followed as those on shore attempted to flee.  The Thean armada was torn to pieces in a matter of moments. The Demons quickly turned their attention toward land.
<p>
The entire port was decimated.  Not even children were spared the horror of watching there insides spill out of their bodies.  The few people who managed to hid or escape later described the creatures as fearsomely intelligent; for they would half to be to set such a flawless trap.  
But this battle would be the demonics, as called by the Therans, only effortless victory.  For Therans were a proud people and now would be rallied to the cause.  Faced with the extinction of their society, they would become as fierce and terrible as those villainous creatures.  And so the first and last Great War in the first age of Thera began.
<p>
It is said that over the next few years the war consumed the beauty that was Thera, leaving the land gray and lifeless.  Whole cities were burned to the ground, while many of the lakes, rivers and streams were tainted with the carcasses of man and monster.  Indeed, there was hardly a place to be found that was not in some way touched by the bloody hand of death.
<p>
To this day those who remember the story, say the gods were heart-broken by what had been done to their world; and soon that sadness turned to a horrifying anger.  People being as superstitious as they are, believed that they were just as much to blame in that travesty.  For was it not man’s contempt and prideful ways that awoke the sleeping threat that had lay in the East?  And so the task of punishment fell to the great God of Light, Enkindle.
<p>
Soon, like the deadly winds that blew the Eastern Ships back to Thera, dark clouds lay on the horizon.  It was in the mist of a great battle that an ominous rain began to fall.  A terrible thunder shook the foundations of stone. Brilliant flashes of lightning blinded all those on the battlefield.
<p>
Some who tell this tale believe that this storm was a final plea from Enkindle for all to throw down their arms and beg for forgiveness.  While others still believe it was an expression of grief, for the God of Light would soon have to blacken the land she shone upon each day.
Still, the Therans and demonics persisted in their battle on the rain-soaked fields of Thera.  Creatures fell to the ground as Theran arrows went forth from their bows into the sky, piercing the flesh of the winged monsters.  Like all the other battles that had been fought between these two races before, many fell that day.
<p>
Unable to appeal to the folly of man and beast, the thunder subsided, the lightning moved into the west, and the blood-rain battlefield dried up.  And as the clouds faded away Enkindle shone her light once more; it would be the one of the last times anyone would see her yellow unbridled glow for an age.  An object, almost obscured by Enkindle’s light at first, was now present near where the god soared in the daytime sky.
<p>
As the days and nights passed, all watched as this new entity descended closer from the heavens to the world below.  Soon the nights gained a reddish hue, and it brought with it the dread of a civilization.  War ceased on both sides, for the gods had brought forth an omen, the Arm of Enkindle, and all would listen.
<p>
After days of waiting for the gods’ final message, one morning brought with it a crimson dawn; with it, came a day of reckoning.  The sky began to rain down fire indiscriminately.  Waves of chaos spread to every corner of the land; Therans took cover where they could, as their winged foes took to the sky in a frenzied madness.  Land and sky was scorched by inferno.
<p>
Many lives were burned down in the city streets, and those that managed to escape the blaze found no reprieve in their homes as their marvelous structures collapsed on top on them.  Cities not been leveled by war were now raised to the ground by fiery blasts.  Whole fields of vegetation and livestock, what little there were, was destroyed.  All the while the great Arm of Enkindle swelled in size in the red sky.  
<p>
Because no one would throw down their arms, it appeared that Enkindle would at last throw down hers.  Those few brave souls that would not cower in fear looked to the sky as a great entity finally fell from its place at a god’s side.  At that moment, no longer was there chaos; the world fell silent, save for the whimpers of the women and children.  
<p>
The Arm of Enkindle was brought to bear on the land of Thera; and as it fell it disappeared behind the mountains of the West.  An intense flash soon followed. With it a low rumble grew into a devastating roar.  Then those who there were there no more; civilization was no more.
<p>
The fallout from the Arm of Enkindle was far reaching, and would last thousands of years.  The sky was blanketed by a thick fog; with it came a bitter chill.  What trees that remained iced over and eventually disappeared all together.  The ground became a sheet of ice covered in snow.  The land itself became a frozen desert where nothing could possibly survive.
<p>
But, there were survivors.  For how else could this story have been told, and endure though all the ages of Thera?  Groups of men, women, and children were scattered throughout the land taking refuge in caves, and digging out shelters in the sides of hills and small mountains.
<p>
Now, sometimes when being told this story, children will be foolish enough to ask how one could survive in such harsh conditions and live in such a desolate time.  “A man must do what he can to live, thus he must do shameful things,” the bearer of the tale would say.  “And so that is why we call upon Enkindle every night at dusk, that she might forgive us for our ancestors’ sins and bring us one more day of light.  And in this we hope to never become hungry savages once more.”
<p>
It seemed as if the extinction of the Theran race was certain.  As the Long Winter drew on, many soon lost what little strand of humanity they had left.  Madness replaced sanity, savagery replaced civility, and knowledge was replaced by ignorance.  That is why so much of their rich history is lost to time, and only tales remain.
<p>
Eventually lunacy subsided.  Savagery was quelled, and people started to gather once more.  What was once lost returned to Thera.   It was hope brought by the returning light of Enkindle.  Had she forgiven man for his follies?  The black clouds that once covered the land lightened to a dark haze, and soon disappeared all together.  The snow melted, giving way to a still scorched Thera, reminding the people of what they and their ancestors had suffered for.
<p>
Many ages had passed and those who had witnessed first hand what terror the Arm of Enkindle had brought to Thera had long since turned to dust.  Still the vivid story of an empire’s demise at the hand of a god lived on in the hearts of their descendants.  And as dawn came, Therans across the land were renewed in their faith, praying to Enkindle, begging her to forgive all of their transgressions and to never leave them again.
<p>
Not long after the dark clouds disappeared, rain began to fall again, and with it life too returned to Thera.  Rivers and lakes warmed as sleeping seeds grew into plants and grass.  Infant trees rose up from the ground and before long forest sprang up.  The world was slowly retuning to the beauty it once was.  Animals filled the land again; small ones at first, but almost immediately more grandiose beasts appeared.  Life was thriving in the land of Thera just like the days of old.  
<p>
For better or worse, it would not be long before the Therans returned to their old ways.  Techniques that were once lost to time, such as farming and cultivating of land, were rediscovered and put to prosperous use.  As populations increased and land became smaller, rival factions of Theans fought each other for possession and control.  Sticks and clubs were replaced, as many soon learned to once again forge minerals into weapons and armors.  The Therans undeniably revisited their old ways, but still they prayed every evening for Enkindle to forgive them for the lives they took or the lies they told.
<p>
And alas, for many years to come things were as bleak as they were during the Long Winter.  Countless people were brutally slaughtered in man’s quest for power.  Much that was built was not long after burned or destroyed completely.  Lands were conquered, and rulers rose from the ranks of small armies.  Soldiers were born and bred from an early age to live and die with honor by their sharp blades.  All this was in service to their lords.
<p>
A thousand years later the land of Thera was splintered into many regions; each one controlled by a different Lord.  Most were small but some functioned as mini empires.  Three stood out above them all; To the East was Vestar, in the north was Draglagar, and with its back to the Western Mountains was Falnor.  
<p>
Each of these three regions was powerful in its own right, but Falnor was the envy of all.  The people there were artistically skilled in craftsmanship.  Every facet of their existence was used to better themselves and their culture.  From the beautiful armors they tempered, to the breathtaking castles and towns they built, every metal or stone was a work of perfection.  If any region represented a fraction of what was once the great First Theran Empire, it was Falnor.
For Years both the Lords of Vestar and Draglagar secretly yearned for the prosperity that Falnor had.  Petty squabbles turned to bloody skirmishes, as soldiers from Vestar began raiding farms and villages on the edge of Falnor’s eastern borders.  Almost immediately Draglagar followed suit and laid siege to Falnor’s northern borders.
<p>
The people of Falnor were for the most part peaceful, trying diplomacy to no avail.  Finally, not wanting to be perceived as weak, the Lord of Falnor ordered his army to invaded Vestar and Draglagar simultaneously.  After burning down several towns and outposts, the soldiers returned to their own lands to strengthen their own borders.  It now became nearly impossible for any outside force to enter the region.  The skill the Falnorians displayed on the battlefield was glorious.  However instead of breaking their enemies’ will, it just strengthened the desire Draglagar and Vestar had for Falnor.  
<p>
Vestar and Draglagar would now stop at nothing to conquer the region and its people, but both knew they could not do on their own.  For years the two regions had fought for dominion over unclaimed lands in Thera, but had now put aside their differences for this one common goal.  Once Falnor was theirs they would split the land in half.
<p>
Their victory, however, would not come easy.  For the walls of Falnorian castles were hard and nigh impenetrable.  The Armors of its soldiers were as well forged as the wills of the men who wore them. And skills of those who wielded its weapons were incredible.
<p>
Thera was again engulfed in war.  Many families would be fractured, and many lives would be lost.  And although Falnor was now outnumbered two to one, the people of that great region held their ground.  So long was the war for Falnor that it would not see its end for a generation.
When the Lords that incited this war finally died the mantle fell to their sons to carry out their legacy.  The new lords of Draglagar and Vestar felt the pressure to bring the fortune of victory that was promised to their people.  It too fell to the new Lord of Falnor to keep a promise; Falnor must continue to fight back the advances of the enemies that threatened its peoples.
<p>
And so our story begins here…
