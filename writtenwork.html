        Rise of the Ancients is a story I began writing in 2003, although I haven’t really been able to deticate any time to it in the last few years. After I was inspired the deep storytelling that J.R.R. Tolkien displayed with The Lord of the Rings, I began writing down ideas for my own world. It was a story about an Empire at war with people of a newly discovered land. But before I really dove into it, I wanted there to be a sense of history the people and the world I was going to create; Tolkien wrote in very much the same way. So I started to create a timeline of “historical events” that would have bearing on the story.
        <p>
        Around the same time I started I began this process, I started taking a creative writing class. For the first assignment, I was to come up with a short story. So I decided to take an event from the timeline I created, and write  tale about it. But as I wrote I began to fall in love with the characters I created found it impossible to end the story; so I kept writing. With my instructors permission I continued to write, turning chapter after chapter. I even carried the work over the another semester and another creative writting class.
        <p>
        So although, I still have yet to begin to write the story I had intended to, below you will find a few sample chapters of a tale that was born out of that idea, begining with a prologue that tells the history behind “this” story. Enjoy ...
