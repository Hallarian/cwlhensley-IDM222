      <h2>The Art of Digital Media</h2>

      <!-- ABOUT DIGITAL MEDIA -->
      <div class="paragraph">
      Not everyone knows what they want to be when they grow up. With me, I didn’t know that I knew it. Or perhaps I was just waiting for technology catch up to my imagination. I have always loved television, movies, games, and have been fascinated with advances in technology that help bring these genres together. This is what interests me so much about digital media.
      <p>
      Digital media can be defined as any media that is encoded into a machine-readable format. It can be created, viewed, distributed, modified and preserved on any electronic device that supports it.
      <p>
      And we all know how increasingly important digital media is becoming in our lives. When I think about how far we have come since the commercialization of the Internet 20 year ago, I am intrigued by where we’ll be 20 years from now. We live in a world where the lines between information and entertainment are being blurred, and in many cases disappearing altogether.
      <p>
      Digital media allows us to be much more than consumers; it allows us to be producers, content creators. If you have access to a computers and the Internet there is a plethora of opportunities to connect, engage and create media and foster relationships in the process. There is much fun to be had in participating in the word of digital media. 
      <p>
      I myself have a creative aptitude and passion for this that I am constantly looking for ways to improve my depth of knowledge, and in turn share what I have learned with others. I acquired some skill sets in this field during my time in the Navy. Typically, I find great interest and motivation using computer programs and software; such as Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator; these and other digital media tools open up so many possibilities for creativity and self-discovery.
      <p>

The idea for the poster itself is based off an story I have been writng over the years. you can find some sample chapters in Communication Studies tab under Fiction. The image was also taken by me.</i></div>
